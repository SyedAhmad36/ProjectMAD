Summary
This project is about a simple login form for user to create an account and login which needs an authentication from firebase.

Objective
1. To utilise the widgets by allowing users to sign in and create an account.
2. To make use of firebase for user authentication.
3. To fetch data online by using HTTP library.

Compilation and running instructions
1. Replace the "pubspec.yaml" file.
2. Replace the "build.gradle" file in the "android folder, and replace the "google-services.json" and "build.gradle" files in the "android>app" folder.
3. I tested this code only with android emulator. So i don't know whether iOS emulator works or not.
4. After running the code, first create and account and set up your email (i.e test@test.com) and password (must be 6 or more characters) and then login.
